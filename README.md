# OpenStack Deployment Guide

## Overview
This guide helps you deploy OpenStack using Kolla-Ansible. This deployment creates a robust cloud environment featuring core OpenStack services, along with monitoring and container orchestration capabilities.

## Architecture
- **Controller Node**: Manages the control plane (API services, databases, messaging)
- **Compute Nodes**: Hosts virtual machines and containers
- **Network Configuration**: Separate interfaces for internal and external traffic

## Features
- Core OpenStack services (Nova, Neutron, Glance, Keystone)
- Cinder Block Storage with LVM backend
- Heat Orchestration
- Prometheus and Grafana monitoring
- Zun container service

## Prerequisites
- Ubuntu-based systems
- Network connectivity between nodes
- SSH access to all nodes
- Sufficient storage for Cinder volumes

## Quick Deployment Steps
1. Clone the repository containing the deployment pipeline
2. Configure your environment variables if needed
3. Run the deployment pipeline
4. Access OpenStack via Horizon dashboard once deployment completes

## Detailed Process
The deployment pipeline handles:
1. Installing dependencies
2. Setting up Python virtual environment
3. Installing Ansible and Kolla-Ansible
4. Configuring global settings
5. Setting up multinode inventory
6. Bootstrapping server nodes
7. Running pre-deployment checks
8. Deploying OpenStack services

## Post-Deployment
After successful deployment, you can:
- Access the OpenStack dashboard
- Create projects, users, and resources
- Launch instances and containers
- Configure networks and storage

## Troubleshooting
If deployment fails, check the logs for detailed information. Common issues include:
- Network connectivity problems
- Insufficient disk space
- Incompatible hardware configurations
